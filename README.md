# Tata-Steel
Finding out insight for Tata Steel to overcome machine failures by using data analysis through python.
The dataset provided in this project represents several operational parameters and failure types machinery used in steel production. The data is synthetically generated based on real-world sceneriaos, allowing us to explore different machine learning techniques to perdict potential failures. By analyzing this data. TATA Steel aims to develop predictive models taht can anticipate machine failures before they occur, thus enabling proactive maintainanace and improved operational efficiency.

**DataSets**
Here the data is divided into two datasets one is train set and another one is test set. By using this dataset we need to perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to ensure the efficiency of the machines increases or not, how it should be done and what are the parameters to be  considered to perform EDA.


**Libraries Used**
The project utilizes a range of Python libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Some of the key libraries include:



1.   **Pandas & NumPy** – For data manipulation, handling missing values, and performing mathematical operations.
2.   **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization to identify trends and patterns in steel production.

**Expected Outcomes & Business Impact**

By implementing a data-driven approach, Tata Steel aims to achieve the following:



1.   **Improved Process Efficiency** – Optimizing operational parameters to maximize productivity and minimize waste.
1.   **Defect Reduction** – Identifying patterns leading to product defects and proactively preventing them.

1.   **Enhanced Quality Control** – Predicting the quality of steel products based on production conditions and adjusting processes accordingly.
2.   **Cost Savings** – Reducing material wastage, energy consumption, and downtime through predictive maintenance.
2.   **Data-Driven Decision Making** – Empowering plant managers and engineers with insights for better decision-making.
